            After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in computer
            engineering/mathematics, I've been living in Ann Arbor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.compendiabio.com">working as a software engineer</a>.
            I may qualify for <a target="_blank" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1942">townie status</a>
            sooner than I wish to. By day I work on web applications that spread knowledge. By night I fight crime.
            I also like writing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.littleleviathan.com">music</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed an interest in photography after my father purchased a DSLR. He'd had an old
            Minolta 35mm film camera for forever but it wasn't until this simpler, sleek technology touched my
            hands that I was inspired to pick it up. I started using his camera more than he did and
            was coerced into purchasing my own. I began with a Sony Alpha but I have been shooting
            Nikon ever since a Christmas vacation theft debacle in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
            I especially enjoy fashion and nature photography. Each provides an opportunity for me
            to develop new relationships and gain insight into people and places. I'm appreciative
            of new outlooks and consider myself a continual learner. I consider wisdom and knowledge
            two of the highest virtues; any who possess them have the tools to build
            virtuosity throughout the rest of their lives.
