  <p>
    I am an American folk musician and digital photographer
    located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I grew up in northern lower Michigan
    near the Sleeping Bear Dunes. This beautiful area has inspired my
    musical style and photography and is apparent in the mood of the songs
    and images I produce.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a University of Michigan alumnus and as such many of my
    images are of the campus and its inhabitants. I provide portraiture
    and fashion photography to students and alumni of the university as
    well as larger services such as wedding and event photography.
  </p>
  <p>
    My other hobbies are myriad and include drawing, web design,
    electrical circuits, board games, and ballroom dancing.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is my goal to serve people in Greater Detroit and far beyond with
    distinctive, memorable images of them and the beautiful world they live in.
